## Data
This respitory contains all the data used for the project Tastes of the Past and referenced by the published article from the project.  
This includes the data from the text analyses and the Taste-Lab, which was held in Amsterdam in April 2024.  
Due to the nature of the project, all the data is in Dutch. Only the graphs directly used in the article have been translate to English.  

## Mapstructure
The files have been organized in two maps: the text analyses data in the AntConc_Research and the data from the Taste-Lab in TasteLab_Data.
In the AntConc research map all the data from the textual analyses have been assembled with submaps of the terms 'Goed' and 'Smakelijk'. These two terms are used in the article.
The Taste lab data consists mostly of single files of all the graphs, tables and the data for the recipe which was used for the Taste lab. Only the forms and results of the Questionary are collected in a separate submap.

## Dataformat
The data have different formats, depending on the type of data. All written text and some tables are docx files.  
The questionforms and the anwsers have been saved as PDF, XLSX and CSV. The CSV was downloaded from GoogleForms which was used to make the questionary. 
The questionary was fully anonymous. The participants of the Taste Lab did approve the use and disclosure of the anwsers when they registered for the panel.
The wordclouds used in the article is a PNG image.
All the data form the text analyses have formats of txt and PNG for pictures. The corpus of the analyses are saved as DB file (database-related), which can be opened with AntConc or any other Text Analysis program.

## Software
For the analyses of the cookbooks and other primary sources from this project, the *Freeware Corpus Analysis toolkit AntConc* was applied.
